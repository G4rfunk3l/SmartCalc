# SmartCalc
My own realization of Smart Calculator (using C language for back and C++ for front) for Mac and Linux.
For build do make build (need to have QT's modules: core, gui, widgets)
## How to install
For install do make install (this will create a directory SmartCalc_v1 with the application inside src).
